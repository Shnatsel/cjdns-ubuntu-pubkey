cjdns repository for Ubuntu (discontinued)
===================

This repository is discontinued due to new restrictive laws regulating the Internet in Russia. In some cases they place responsibility on the "proprietor of the software". Which open-source software does not have. So the story will go something like [this](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/24/dmitry-bogatov-tor-russia/).

In light of the above maintaining this repository is no longer worth the risk.
